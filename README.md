## üìò Project: Philosophers (42 school)

**Philosophers** is one of the core projects in the **42 school** curriculum, based on the classic *Dining Philosophers Problem* ‚Äî a fundamental exercise in **concurrency** and **synchronization** in computer science.

---

### üß† Project Objective

The goal is to simulate a group of philosophers sitting at a table, each alternating between **thinking** and **eating**, while sharing limited resources (**forks**) without causing:

* **Deadlocks**
* **Race conditions**
* **Starvation**

The project emphasizes:

* Managing **threads** or **processes** correctly
* Synchronizing actions using **mutexes**
* Implementing accurate **timing logic** (e.g., tracking when a philosopher dies)
* Ensuring clean and safe **resource allocation and deallocation**

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Skills Required

* Proficiency in **C programming**
* Understanding of **POSIX threads** (`pthread`) and **mutexes**
* Basic knowledge of **concurrent programming concepts**
* Ability to **debug multi-threaded applications**

---

### üöÄ Skills Gained

By completing this project, you will improve and solidify the following skills:

* Hands-on experience with **threading**, **mutex locking**, and **timing**
* Writing **deterministic**, **safe**, and **efficient** concurrent code
* Applying proper **resource management** in multi-threaded environments
* Structuring and **modularizing code** in C
* Designing and implementing **concurrent simulations**
